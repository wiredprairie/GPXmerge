# GPXMerge #
A very simple tool for merging GPX files (from devices like a Garmin eTrex 30 for example) into a single GPX file named "merged.gpx". 

I created this out of frustration that the GPS would create many small files that then were very frustrating to organize and manage inside of Adobe Lightroom. One file however is quite simple! 

## Usage ##
	GPXMerge - merges GPX files into a single file.
	GPXMERGE source-path
	  source-path         Specifies the folder to non-recursively search.
						  All files with the extension .GPX are merged
						  into a single GPX file named MERGED.GPX.
	Skips duplicate segments.




## Build Instructions ##
This has been only tested with Microsoft Visual Studio 2012. You should be able to load the project file and compile after downloading and
adding [boost](http://www.boost.org/ "boost - free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.") to the additional include directories in VS.
